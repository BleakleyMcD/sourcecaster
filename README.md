## Resource for Historians working with digital primary sources

### What it is

Historians spend a lot of time in archives, physical and digital. Whether it's capturing images of sources with a camera, or gathering digitized versions, there comes a time when they need to manage, modify, and even augment the stuff. There are ways to go about this with something like the Python programming language, but it turns out a lot of what you need can be managed with small but powerful programs run via the command line (Terminal, if you're on a Mac). [The Sourcecaster](http://thomasgpadilla.github.io/sourcecaster/ "The Sourcecaster") exists to gather useful commands that can help Historians work through common challenges that come up when working with digital primary sources.

### How you can help

If you have suggestions for commands that help you with your work, or really any thoughts that can help make The Sourcecaster better, feel free to contribute to the codebase of the project, or shoot an email to [Thomas Padilla](https://thomaspadilla.org "Thomas Padilla") directly. 

### Dependencies

To take advantage of all commands in The Sourcecaster install the following:
* [wget] (https://www.gnu.org/software/wget/ "wget")- lets you download (get) stuff from the web in bulk (images, sound files, etc.) 
* [tesseract] (https://github.com/tesseract-ocr "tesseract") - lets you perform optical character recognition on PDFs, making them text searchable
* [ffmpeg] (https://ffmpeg.org/ "ffmpeg") - manipulate multiple types of media (moving images, image, etc.)
* [imagemagick] (http://www.imagemagick.org/script/index.php "imagemagick") - manipulate images
