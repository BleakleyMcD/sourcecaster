# The Sourcecaster

## A resource for Historians working with digital primary sources

### What it is

Historians spend a lot of time in archives, physical and digital. Whether it's capturing images of manuscripts with a camera, or gathering digitized versions, there comes a time when they need to manage, modify, and even augment the stuff. There are ways to go about this with something like the Python programming language, but it turns out most of what is needed is in the command line (if you're on a mac) and the command prompt (if you are on a PC). The Sourcecaster gathers some small but powerful commands to help Historians work through some common challenges working with digital primary sources.

### How you can help

If you have suggestions for commands that could be helpful, or really any thoughts that can help make The Sourcecaster better, feel free to contribute to the codebase of the project, or shoot an email to [Thomas Padilla](https://thomaspadilla.org "Thomas Padilla") directly.
