# The Sourcecaster

## A resource for Historians working with digital primary sources

Historians spend a lot of time in archives, physical and digital. Whether you're capturing images of manuscripts with a camera, or gathering digitized versions, there comes a time when you need to manage, modify, and even augment your stuff. There are ways to go about this with something like the Python programming language, but it turns out you have most of what you need in the command line (if you're on a mac) and the command prompt (if you are on a PC). The Sourcecaster gathers some small but powerful commands to help you work through some common challenges working with digital primary sources.

Click on a button and it will show you a basic command that you can use to do what you need, without too much tinkering. We've documented below each command and what each piece does.

For many of these commands you can get a fuller breakdown using explainshell.
